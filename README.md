## Introduction

Ordering food at a restaurant often involves interacting with staff members, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. The OrderBot aims to automate this process by providing a conversational interface that allows users to place pizza orders. It uses natural language processing techniques to understand user requests and provide appropriate responses.

The project consists of two main components: data collection and bot implementation. The data collection phase involves collecting user prompts and assistant responses to build a training dataset for the bot. The bot implementation phase uses the collected data to train a model that can accurately understand and respond to user orders.

## Features

- User-friendly conversational interface for ordering pizzas.
